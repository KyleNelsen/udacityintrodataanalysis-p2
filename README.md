This is my second project for the intro to data analysis part of the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree. It involves performing an A/B test for an e-commerce website to determine whether the site should move to a new design.

Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook - all of the code

ab_data.csv - file that contains data on test users

countries.csv - file that contains the country of each user
